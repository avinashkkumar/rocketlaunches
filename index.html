                <p>One of the most difficult job to explore the space is to launch the spacecraft, satellite and rover
                    through the rocket. This goes more complicated as the mission goes further from the earth, there are
                    complications like delay in signal transmission. As there are delay in signal communication there
                    are
                    chances that something happens to satellite, rover or the spacecraft and till any instruction is
                    sent
                    the mission is already a failure. This thing was seen in the Chandrayaan-2 when the rover crashed
                    into
                    the lunar surface due to communication break.</p>

                            workhorse launch vehicle of India with 39 consecutively successful missions by June 2017.
                            During 1994-2017 period, the vehicle has launched 48 Indian satellites and 209 satellites

                        <p class="r2">Sounding rockets are one or two stage solid propellant rockets used for probing
                            the upper
                            atmospheric regions and for space research. They also serve as easily affordable platforms
                            to test or prove prototypes of new components or subsystems intended for use in launch
                            vehicles and satellites. With the establishment of the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching
                            Station (TERLS) in 1963 at Thumba, a location close to the magnetic equator, there was a
                            quantum jump in the scope for aeronomy and atmospheric sciences in India. The launch of the
                            first sounding rocket from Thumba near Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala on 21 November 1963,
                            marked the beginning of the Indian Space Programme . Sounding rockets made it possible to
                            probe the atmosphere in situ using rocket-borne instrumentation. The first rockets were
                            two-stage rockets imported from Russia (M-100) and France (Centaure). While the M-100 could
                            carry a payload of 70 kg to an altitude of 85 km, the Centaure was capable of reaching 150
                            km with a payload of approximately 30 kg.</p>
                        <p class="r2">
                            ISRO started launching indigenously made sounding rockets from 1965 and experience gained
                            was of immense value in the mastering of solid propellant technology. In 1975, all sounding
                            rocket activities were consolidated under the Rohini Sounding Rocket (RSR) Programme. RH-75,
                            with a diameter of 75mm was the first truly Indian sounding rocket, which was followed by
                            RH-100 and RH-125 rockets. The sounding rocket programme was the bedrock on which the
                            edifice of launch vehicle technology in ISRO could be built. It is possible to conduct
                            coordinated campaigns by simultaneously launching sounding rockets from different locations.
                            It is also possible to launch several sounding rockets in a single day.
